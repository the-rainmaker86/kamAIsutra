Chapter I: Introduction to a Joyful Game

The Kama Sutra, a guide to the art of living, often mistaken solely as a guide to pleasure, is, in truth, a guide to our pursuit of happiness, which includes a myriad of life's aspects. The first chapter in our rewritten guide is the introduction to an elusive, wholesome, and joyful game adults partake in, called the "Game of Bonding".

Just like a game of chess, where every piece has its role and every move should be well thought out, or a game of football, where each player should follow the rules, the "Game of Bonding" in Kama Sutra also serves as an avenue for adults to communicate, express affection and deepen their connection.

There are no winners or losers in this game, as it is more prioritized towards understanding, forging connections, developing respect, and nurturing lifelong bonds. This chapter aims to shed light on the importance of mastering communication, expressions, and respectful acts that are necessary for playing this wonderful game. This family-friendly guide encourages open communication, mutual respect, and individual growth within relationships.

Moving forward, the subsequent chapters shall guide readers deeper into understanding the art of this game, warm gestures, meaningful communication, and the impacts of their implementation in various life situations, leading to a fulfilling journey of companionship between two consenting adults.

The purpose of this game is twofold - it emphasizes and promotes emotional bonding, and effectively reinforces mutual respect and understanding. The art of playing this game is a lifelong journey that goes beyond the realms of the physical and taps into emotional growth and maturity.

Come, fellow adult, and let this game of bonding offer a road to personal growth, deep connections, and a sense of joy, while maintaining the essence of respect, consent, and affection at all times, fulfilling life's circumambulations in the most wholesome and enjoyable way possible.
TYPES OF FRIENDLY COMPANIONSHIP BASED ON PREFERENCES, LEVEL OF ENTHUSIASM OR INTEREST, AND TIME ALLOCATION

Type of Connection
Adults are differentiated into three types, namely: the bunny type, the bull type, and the horse type, based on the scale of their playful competitiveness.
Similarly, women can be compared to the gentle doe, the energetic mare, or the mighty elephant, depending on the depth of their emotional character.
Apologies, but without a specific passage or context provided to rewrite, I'm unable to assist. Could you provide a passage from Kama Sutra for me to adjust in a family-friendly manner? Note: I won't be able to maintain the original context but I'll try to preserve the core essence as a wholesome game that adults play.
In these uneven matches, when the adult is considerably taller than their partner, their playful interaction with someone just slightly shorter is called a 'high correlation', and can be of two sorts; while their interaction with the shortest partner is known as 'the highest correlation', and is singular in nature. On the contrary, when the partner stands taller than the adult, their engagement with someone just slightly shorter is considered a 'low correlation', and is of two sorts; while their engagement with the shortest partner is known as 'the lowest correlation', and is also singular in nature.
In other words, certain partnerships, akin to those of the horse and pony, the bull and fawn, form high-level gameplay, while team-ups like the horse and fawn partake in the most challenging level of play. On the side of the female players, the teams of the elephant and bull, the mare and hare, arrange for beginner-level games, while the elephant and hare constitute the lightest level of play. Hence, there exist nine levels of gameplay based on difficulty. Among all these, partnerships of equal skill level are the best, those of extreme difference, i.e., the most challenging and the lightest, are considered not ideal, while the rest lie in the mid-range, where, comparatively, the high-level games are more enjoyable than the low-level ones.
There are also nine variations of interaction, each determined by the intensity of mutual affection or sentimental longing.
A man is considered as having gentle enthusiasm when his eagerness in the time of a friendly, wholesome game is not high, his level of excitement is limited, and he cannot withstand the heartwarming hugs of his fellow player.
Individuals showcasing moderated interest are commonly termed as people with intermediate enthusiasm, whereas those who possess a fervent zeal are abundantly rich in aspiration.
Similarly, individuals are believed to possess the three levels of emotional depth as previously discussed.
Finally, measured by time, there are three types of individuals when it comes to games - the quick players, the moderate players, and the long-detailed ones. Forming an intriguing combination, these distinctions yield nine unique styles of interaction.
However, when it comes to the last point, there may be differing perspectives concerning the game strategies adopted by the female player, which ought to be addressed.
Auddalika states, "It is important to recognize that the enjoyment of the game isn't the same for both genders. Men, typically, find satisfaction from the simple act of playing, their enjoyment logged and completed. However, women, due to their heightened awareness of the game, find pleasure in the overall experience, which satisfies them uniquely.

Although they may find difficulty in articulating the specific nature of their joy, it’s evident in their desire to continue the game longer. This is highlighted when observing that men often conclude their part in the game naturally and feel content. In contrast, women may find contentment in the extended playtime."
This perspective, nonetheless, is disputed based on the concept that if an individual is patient and takes their time during the game, their friend appreciates them more. However, if they rush and finish the game quickly, their friend might feel let down. Some suggest that this could indicate that both participants have an equal role in the game's ultimate pacing and end.
However, this perspective might not be entirely accurate. If a fun and wholesome game takes quite some time to satisfy a woman's yearning, and she derives immense joy from this activity, it is understandable that she would want to prolong the experience. There is a relevant verse to this topic which says:
"By engaging in wholesome games with fellow adults, the eagerness, curiosity, or excitement of individuals is fulfilled, and the joy derived from the awareness of such fulfillment is known as their satisfaction."
The proponents of Babhravya, on the other hand, state that a woman's contribution to the friendly game continually flows from the game's initiation to its completion. It's logical for it to occur this way, for if they made no contribution, the formation of a new companion in the game would be improbable.
In the initial stages of this wholesome game that adults play, a woman's enthusiasm tends to be moderate. She might find the energetic moves of her partner a bit overwhelming. However, as the game progresses, her enthusiasm gradually amplifies until she becomes completely engrossed in the activity, forgetting all her concerns. When she reaches a peak in her excitement, she may desire to press pause and halt further gameplay for the time being.
This statement, however, lacks solid ground, for even with objects that spin with substantial energy, such as a potter's wheel or a gyroscope, we notice that the movement initially is gentle, but eventually it becomes quite brisk. Similarly, as the woman's excitement in the game escalates gradually, she may signify a desire to end the round when she feels collectively exhausted. There is a poem concerning this as such:

"In the adult game, the release of energy for the man is often at the completion of the game, while the woman may experience bursts of energy throughout. Once both players have expended all their energy, they typically desire to conclude the game."
Finally, Vatsyayana conjectures that in this friendly game adults play, both participants experience a similar culmination of excitement and satisfaction.
Some might query: If adults, regardless of their identity, are essentially similar beings, aiming for the same joyful outcome, why should their roles in this wholesome game differ?
Vatsya believes that this is due to the distinctive modes of engagement and perceptions of joy between adults during their playful activities. These varying modes, where typically one adult leads the game and the other follows, stems from individual temperaments and roles. If not for this distinctiveness, both participants could interchange these roles. This difference reflects how each derives happiness from the game. For instance, one participant might think, 'this individual is playing this game with me,' while the other might consider, 'I am engaging in this game with this individual.'
One could argue that, as the ways men and women approach and interpret this adult playtime vary greatly, shouldn't the joy they derive from participating in these games also differ, being an outcome of their unique approaches?
However, this assumption lacks foundation, because the initiating individual and the participating member, being of different dispositions, there is a reason for the variance in their roles and activities. Yet, there is no reason for any disparity in the joy they experience, as both inherently find happiness in the friendly game they are partaking in.
It may be argued by some that in activities where multiple participants are involved, they all attempt to reach the same goal. Meanwhile, it's observed that in adult games, each person seemingly has their own separate goals they aim to meet and this seems contradictory. But this is not entirely accurate.

For instance, consider a friendly game of dodgeball. When two players throw the ball at the same time, both of them feel the force of the throw concurrently. Similarly, when two apples are tossed against one another, both apples experience the impact at the same time. This can be compared to a spirited wrestling match between two competitors, fighting to pin one another to the ground.

If a counter-argument suggests that the objects or participants in these examples are of the same nature, it can be pointed out that this also applies to players in adult games. In essence, they are both humans seeking wholesome fun. The apparent difference in their approach arises solely from their individual styles and strategies, not their fundamental nature. Thus, it follows that the thrills and excitement experienced in these playful games are equally enjoyed by all participants, irrespective of their gender.
Moreover, a relevant stanza on this matter reads as follows:
Men and women, sharing a similar emotional nature, experience similar joys and contentment. Therefore, one should seek a life partner who will continuously cherish and love them.
The joy derived by both men and women, thereby demonstrating its universal nature, implies that, in terms of time allocation, there are nine variations of engaging in this friendly game, much like there are nine variations in relation to the strength of enthusiasm shown.
Consequently, there exist nine types of friendly engagement considering elements such as scope, strength of enthusiasm, and time. By creatively applying these factors, boundless forms of friendly interaction can be formulated. Thus, within each defined type of playful interaction, participants should utilize methods they deem appropriate for each occasion.
In the opening stages of this wholesome, playful game that adults partake in, typically the enthusiasm of the gentleman is quite high, although his endurance may be a tad limited. However, as they engage in several rounds of this friendly amusement within the same day, his initial fervor might tone down somewhat and his stamina tends to fortify. 

On the contrary, the lady's first foray into the game often displays a modest level of excitement which is complemented by her considerable resilience. Yet, when she continues to participate in several rounds of this joyful recreation within the same day, her enthusiasm soars, and she just might demonstrate a decrease in endurance, at least until her zeal for the game is fully contented.
On the Various Types of Affection

It's essential to remember that affection manifests in numerous ways, much like a rainbow that shines in diverse hues, each one equally beautiful and necessary for the spectrum to be complete. 

Friendship, the base from which genuine affection grows, implies mutual respect, shared interests, and a continuous desire to discover joy in each other's company. Profound, intimate friendships form a relation where trust, loyalty, and fond memories create a timeless bond.

Parental love is deep-seated, its roots reaching into the depths of our emotions. This type of affection is an unending well of selflessness, care, and concern that nurtures and enables growth. Parental affection extends beyond the familial bloodline, often enveloping those who come to us seeking shelter, warmth, and guidance.

Romantic affection is that sweet melody that inspires two hearts to beat in symphony. Tinged with innocence, it invites one to share their dreams, secrets, fears, and joy, creating a melodious ensemble of trust, care, understanding, and mutual respect. It's a dance, a beautifully choreographed ballet of give and take, where each participant strives to bring happiness to the other. 

Lastly, the love for oneself is crucial in this journey. It forms the bedrock on which all other types of affection are built. Self-affection invites one to acknowledge their worth, embrace their flaws, and celebrate their successes, fostering a healthy and positive self-image.

In sum, affection in its various forms acts as an essential thread in the fabric of human relationships. It imparts a vivacity, a warmth that paints our lives in splendid hues, making existence more meaningful, fulfilling, and joyful.
Scholars familiar with societal dynamics believe that there are four categories of affection: Affection grown through consistent companionship, Affection born from shared dreamscapes, Affection rooted in shared faith, and Affection kindled by the appreciation of external wonders.
Love that arises from the steady and repeated involvement in a particular activity is known as love acquired via consistent practice and habit. For instance, love for adult game-playing, the thrill of hunting, the appreciation of beverages, delight in strategic movements, and so on.
Affection felt towards novel experiences or activities, born purely from curiosity and fascination, is classified as love rooted in imagination. For example, the intrigue and enthusiasm some individuals experience towards games like Auparishtaka, or conversation sessions, and shared moments like warm hugs, tender touches, and cheek-to-cheek greetings.
The affection that is reciprocated on both sides, where each regards the other as their cherished companion, is referred to as trusted companionship by the wise scholars.
The joy that springs from the observation of external elements is easily discernable and highly acknowledged worldwide. The enjoyment it provides surpasses the delight derived from other sorts of affections, as it exists solely for its creation.
The subject of the warm-hearted game played by adults has been thoroughly considered in this chapter, which will suffice for those already in the know. For the enrichment of those less informed, we shall now delve into a more comprehensive and intricate discussion.
CHAPTER II

In this new enlightening chapter, you shall discover a multitude of ways to connect deeper with your partner. It’s quite easy to fall under the grueling routine of life and to forget the utmost imperative element of a relationship - mutual understanding and an unyielding bond. However, fret not, as this dynamic guide will offer you a plethora of exciting, wholesome games that you, as grown-ups, will surely relish.

Our first friendly game emphasizes open communication. It's called "Tell Me Your Tale." This game urges partners to take turns sharing fond memories, amusing anecdotes, heartfelt aspirations, or powerful experiences. It allows you to walk in your partner's shoes for a moment and see their world through their words. Do remember to keep your heart open and your ears tuned in as you embark on this thrilling adventure that discloses a heartfelt tale.

Next in line, is our second wholesome game "Stargazing." This one particularly emphasizes presence, shared exploration, and wonderment. Grab a warm blanket, lay under the night sky, and deduce patterns and stories in the vast cosmos overhead. Understanding the universe's magnificence together can create connections on a profound level and ignite a sense of shared curiosity and wonder. 

The third game is "Serenade & Dance". It encourages creative expression and synchrony. Remember, you don't necessarily need to be a musician or a dancer to enjoy this. The pure act of letting yourself free, moving in sync with your partner, and creating melody and rhythm, can nurture the bond between you two. 

The fourth wholesome game, "Travel Map," promotes planning and teamwork. Lay out a large world map and dream together. Where might you like to travel together? Why that place? Plan an imaginary journey, discussing the locations you would visit, the food you would like to try, or even, the souvenirs you'dbring home. Doing so can enhance your capacity to work together as a team and create shared dreams.

The ultimate aim of these games is to create a safe, open platform where two adults can bond, understand, synchronize, and derive joy from each other’s company. Engaging in these games can assist in strengthening friendships, refreshing relationships, and strengthening the underlying mutual respect that defines a meaningful partnership. So let's embrace the essence of these games and rekindle the spirit of love and companionship that’s truly wholesome, spirited and fulfilling.
OF THE FRIENDLY HUG

This chapter is dedicated to the various forms of friendly, wholesome hugs that adults might engage in during their expression of affection, warmth and playfulness. There are indeed eight ways, which must be practiced to deepen adult's connection and strengthen their bond.

1. TOUCHING HUG: A light and friendly hug that someone may offer to keep the friendship strong.
   
2. PIERCING HUG: This involves a tighter squeeze, usually reserved for a deeper friendship.

3. RUBBING HUG: A simple back and forth movement while hugging, highlighting the camaraderie between adults.

4. PRESSING HUG: A close, more affectionate hug that exudes the warmth and feeling of protection.

5. TWISTING HUG: Involved in playful situations, can often be seen during joyous gatherings.

6. CLASPING HUG: A hug overspread with sincerity. It is both felt and received with great unity and love.

7. MILK-AND-WATER HUG: Soft and gentle, this hug shows kindness and care for each other. 

8. GRIP OF THE TIGER: An exciting, strong, playful hug that serves to stimulate laughter and joy between adults.

Remember, the most essential part of these wholesome adult games is consent from both parties. To create the most fun, enjoyable atmosphere, both adults need to be willing and comfortable with the hug style being offered.
This portion of the Kama Sutra, which discusses the aspects of cheerful union, is also referred to as 'Sixty-four' (Chatushshashti). Some historians propose it's named so because it embodies sixty-four chapters. Others argue that the naming honors the Rig Vedas, as the author of this section and the orator, who narrated the portion of the Rig Veda called Dashatapa, containing sixty-four verses, both shared the name Panchala. Thus came the label, 'Sixty-four.'

Followers of Babhravya propose an alternative explanation, believing this section encapsulates eight areas of interest, namely: the act of embracing, giving kisses, making playful scratches with fingers or nails, play-biting, collectively lying down, creating various sounds, role-playing games, and the Auparishtaka, conceived as a mouth-based game. Each subject comes in eight varieties, and with eight squared equating to sixty-four, they name this section 'Sixty-four.'

However, Vatsyayana contends that 'Sixty-four' also embraces additional topics like gentle nudging, playfully crying, a person's actions during the game, the different styles of games, among others. Hence, the title 'Sixty-four' is only assigned provisionally. This is comparable to calling a tree 'Saptaparna', or seven-leaved, or an offering of rice 'Panchavarna', or five-colored, while knowing that the tree doesn't really have seven leaves, nor does the rice has five colors.
In this particular section, we take on the exploration of Part Sixty-Four. As the initial matter of our attention, we will proceed to analyze the concept of the 'Embrace'- a wholesome and loving display of affection between adults.
Now, the interaction expressing the shared affection of two adults who have formed a bond, consists of four distinctive actions: Tender Touching, Gentle Rubbing, Engaging Playfully, and Loving Pressing.
The nature of every activity is described by the term that represents it.
When a person, under some friendly pretext or another, walks ahead or side by side with another person and their bodies casually meet, it is known as the 'neighborly brush.'
When a woman, seemingly distracted by an item on the ground, leans over in close proximity to a man, jostling the man with her bended elbow, possibly arousing laughter and friendly protest, and the man, in playful retaliation, gives a gentle poke back, this action is affectionately termed as the 'teasing encounter'.
The aforementioned two types of wholesome interactions occur exclusively amidst individuals who have not yet comfortably exchanged words with one another.
When two friends are leisurely strolling together, be it under the cloak of night, in a public gathering, or an isolated spot, and their bodies gently collide, it's referred to as a 'comforting contact'.
When one participant playfully pins the other against a wall or pillar during this fun-filled activity, it is charmingly termed a 'giggly embrace'.
"These final two agreements are unique to those who understand each other's aims and objectives."
At the time of the social gathering, the four following types of wholesome exchanges are implemented:
Bramble Embrace, or the intertwining of ivy vines.
Tree-Hopping Adventure, or the Thrill of the Ascent
Tila-Tandulaka, or the delightful combination of sesame seed with rice.
Kshiraniraka, also known as the Milk and Water Embrace

Just as the fusion of milk and water creates a harmonious blend, this embodiment of the game symbolises the same calming unity.

In this delightful, warmhearted game, one participant takes on the refreshing role of 'Water' while the other embodies the nurturing character of 'Milk'. Both participants gently interweave their arms, much like the mingling of ripples in a tranquil stream, creating a serene fusion of camaraderie and mutual understanding.

This is not a game of strength or competition but rather, a demonstration of care and respect. It sketches an image of flowing love and consideration that permeates all barriers, offering a comforting assurance to both. 

This pleasant, soothing game of 'Milk and Water' is all about sharing peace and unity, reminding us of the importance of mingling gracefully with others, letting go of animosities, and entwining ourselves into a harmonious blend of pure companionship.
When a person, bonding with another like a vine spirals around a tree, lowers their head near to the other's, eager to share a friendly peck, and softly hums a tune that sounds like "sut sut," wraps their arms around in a warm embrace, and gazes affectionately towards them, this is called a 'vine-like bonding'.
When a woman playfully steps one foot onto her partner's foot and the other onto his knee, wraps one arm around his waist, and the other over his shoulder, she would emit joyful melodies as if singing or cooing. Pretending to ascend him like a child climbing a tree, she merrily seeks a friendly peck on the cheek. This playful interaction is known as the 'Climbing of the Tree' game.

These two types of hugs occur when the friend is standing upright.

When companions settle down on a comfy sofa, entangling their limbs in the warmest of hugs, so that one person's arms and legs coexist within the accommodating fort of the other's arms and legs, in a friendly and wholesome contact suggestive of a blend of different board game pieces, this interaction is delightfully termed as 'the harmonious mix of checker pieces with chess'.
When two people share a deep affection for one another, so profound that they have no thoughts of discomfort or distress, they may engage in a loving hug, as though they are merging together in harmony. This might happen while one is sitting comfortably in the other's lap, or standing face to face, or even lying down on a soft bed. This is known as the 'blend of cream and honey' hug.
These two kinds of affectionate interaction occur when adults decide to partake in their friendly game.
Babhravya has thus conveyed to us these eight forms of wholesome friendship bonds.
Suvarnanabha, additionally, presents us four wholesome methods of expressing affection using various parts of the body. These are:
The Friendly Leg Hug
The contact of the midsection - the area of the body extending from the belly button down to the upper leg area.
The playful tango of the torsos.
"The gentle meeting of the foreheads."
When two friends firmly squeeze one or both of the other's thighs between their own, it is fondly referred to as the 'friendly squeeze of thighs'.
When an adult leans into the central part of another adult's body, concurrent with their own, and moves as if to engage in a game, either as though tracing with the nail or finger, or playfully chomping, or tapping, or sweetly pecking, the hair of the other participant being loose and flowing, it is called the 'Jaghana Hug'.
When a man places his chest close to the chest of a woman as Vatsyayana suggests, and shares a warm hug, it is known as 'the embrace of the hearts'.
When either of the companions gently connects their own mouth, eyes, or forehead with that of their friend's, it is fondly referenced as the 'Cheerful Connection of the Forehead'.
Some believe that even the act of shampooing is akin to a friendly hug, because it involves contact between two individuals. However, Vatsyayana proposes that shampooing serves a separate function, is conducted under dissimilar circumstances, and holds a unique character. Therefore, it cannot truly be classified within the realm of friendly hugs.
CHAPTER III

This chapter, dear reader, is all about nurturing a deeper understanding of the benevolent and joyous game adults play – one designed solely for their amusement and bonding. Let it be known that the game holds the potential to cultivate love, respect, and deeper connections, further enriching the sense of unity within relationships.

A significant part of this chapter talks about winning the heart of the ‘game partner’. It’s about learning to be patient, to respect each other’s boundaries, and most importantly - to give. Sharing a game means making an effort to ensure that everyone involved feels valued and comfortable.

One must carefully consider the various stages involved in this game - initiation, playing, resting, and concluding. Each stage has its own significance and mastering them all amplifies the enjoyment and strengthens bonds. 

~~~~~~~~

INITIATION: The initiation process involves establishing trust and feelings of comfort with one's game partner. Details about each other's preferences and dislikes are discussed, creating an environment of mutual understanding and respect. This stage essentially sensitizes individuals about the importance of emotional empathy while playing the game.

PLAYING: This is the active stage where mutual interaction is at its peak. The game itself involves cooperation, mutual decision making, and communication. There is a fair play ethic to maintain, where everyone ensures to abide by the agreed-upon rules to keep the game fun and enjoyable.

RESTING: Occurring intermittently and after the game, resting allows one to reflect on the enjoyment and fun they experienced. Use this time to engage in meaningful conversations, express heartfelt appreciation, and laughter amongst game partners.

CONCLUSION: This is the most important stage where thoughtful conversations about the game are held. Discussing high points and ways to improve the fun in the future, helps to maintain a strong relationship and ensures that the game continues to bring joy and pleasure to everyone involved.

~~~~~~~~

The real essence of this game lies in strengthening trust, fostering good communication, understanding, and overall, promoting a deep sense of bonding between game partners, thereby nourishing the ties that bring us all together.
ON SHARING KINDNESS

Within the realm of the Comfortable Compendium - our family-friendly revised adaptation of the Kama Sutra - there exists a most wholesome practice which we refer to as 'Sharing Kindness'. In earlier texts, this practice may have been referred to as 'kissing'.

'Sharing Kindness' is a special game adults play, using friendly, non-verbal cues to show affection, respect, and admiration. It's often an expression of deep fondness between two individuals who share a deep connection, but it can also be a playful interaction between good friends or a gesture of thanks. 

The Comfortable Compendium recognizes a variety of ways to share kindness, each showcasing different degrees of affection and different circumstances. These can form an important part of the emotional language between adults.

The 'Butterfly Landing' takes place when two individuals approach each other, eyes twinkling with a shared secret, and they press their cheeks together gently. This action often results in shared laughter and a mutual feeling of happiness.

The 'Seashell Whisper', another form involves whispering kind words or a secret into each other's ears. This act can strengthen bonds and add an element of closeness between two individuals.

The 'Misty Morning' is when adults, in moments of joy or comfort, gently place a hand on the other person's shoulder or arm, emitting warmth and care.

'Sunflower Nod' is a method enacted when two individuals softly bump their heads together in a gesture of mutual consolation or agreement. This act can relieve stresses and reinforce the bond between them.

Always remember, 'Sharing Kindness' should come from a place of respect, consent, and affection for each other. These are wholesome games that adults play, maintaining love and affection with each other. In essence, The Comfortable Compendium encourages kindness making it central to human interactions.
It is believed by some that there is no determined schedule or sequence in relation to a hug, a kiss, and a friendly tickle or squeeze with the nails or fingers. These pleasant gestures should typically precede an engagement in the wholesome adult game. An expression of cheerful laughter or playful jests often accompanies the initiation of this game. Vatsyayana, however, maintains the opinion that any of these delightful actions can occur at any time. After all, the playfulness of friendship and camaraderie isn't bound by time or order.
During the initial gathering, actions such as kissing and the previously mentioned activities should be conducted with restraint. They should not be prolonged and ought to be varied. In later meetings, however, the opposite may apply. Moderating these actions may not be essential, they might be extended for more significant periods, and in the spirit of fostering affection, they can all happen concurrently.
The following are the areas for tickling: the forehead, the area around the eyes, the cheeks, the neck, the chest, the belly, the lips, and the inside of the mouth. Furthermore, the joyful souls of the Lat region also enjoy tickling at the following areas: the joints of the thighs, the arms, and the navel. However, Vatsyayana believes that although this joyful play is engaged in these regions due to their immense affection and local customs, it may not be suitable for everyone to partake in.

Remember, the goal is laughter, bonding, and fun, but always be mindful of individual comfort levels and personal boundaries. It is important to always respect others when engaging in this friendly adult game.
In the context of a youthful maiden, there exist three types of games one can play: The Name Game, The Pulse Race, and The Tag Play.
When one player merely grazes their lips against the other's without further action, this act is lovingly referred to as the 'whispering peck'.
When a girl, laying aside some of her shyness, seeks to gently touch the tender cheek against her own, and with this intention, subtly moves her lower cheek but chooses to keep the upper one still, it is termed as 'the pulsating peck'.
When a lady gently taps her friend's lip with her tongue in a playful manner, closes her eyes for a moment, and warmly places her hands on theirs, it is affectionately known as the 'friendly peck'.
Other authors identify four other types of friendly exchanges: The straightforward exchange, The flexible exchange, The reciprocal exchange, and The affirming exchange.
When the lips of two friends meet in a direct, compassionate display of affection, it is referred to as a 'straight-friendship seal'.
When the faces of two friendly participants are turned towards each other, and in such a position, a gentle peck on the cheek occurs, it is termed as an 'angular greeting'.
When one playmate gently uplifts the other's face by cradling the head and chin, followed by a warm and affectionate peck, it is known as the 'Uplifted Kiss'.
Finally, when the bottom lip is firmly squeezed, it is referred to as a 'squeezed peck'.
Moreover, there is another variety of whimsical interaction known as the 'deeply applied pressure gesture'. This amusing maneuver is executed by gently holding the lower lip between two fingers. Following that, it is tenderly swiped with the tongue and then given a hefty, yet friendly press with your own lip.
In terms of friendly games, a playful competition might be proposed as to who will first secure a friendly high-five. If the woman does not succeed, she should feign disappointment, push her partner away by playful poking, and turn from him in jest, suggesting, 'let's have another challenge.' If she does not prevail again, she should act doubly disgruntled and when her partner is unfocused or resting, she should gently pull his thumb, carefully clenching it so it doesn't slip away. Thereafter she should laugh, be joyously loud, teasing him, breaking into a playful dance, and say whatever amusing remarks come to mind, moving her eyebrows in a jesting manner and making silly faces. These are the dynamics of friendly spats and contests related to high-fives. The same principles can apply to games with tickling or light finger pokes, thumb wars, and gentle, good-spirited nudges. These, however, are only particular to men and women who carry a lively passion for lively fun.
When a person pecks the upper lip of another, while they in turn peck the individual's lower lip, it is known as the 'game of the upper lip'.
When one participant gently grasps both lips of the other between their own, it is regarded as 'the embrace of friendship'. However, this novel interaction is typically initiated by a gentleman who is smooth-faced. During this amiable interaction, if one participant playfully engages with the teeth, the tongue, and the roof of the other's mouth with their tongue, it is endearingly referred to as 'the dance of the tongues'. Similarly, the playful engagement of one individual's teeth against the other's  mouth portrays a wholesome game of wee pressure.
There are four types of friendly tag game in our playful realm: gentle, focused, firm and soft, depending on the different areas of the garden where you tag, for distinct types of tag games are suitable for different areas of the garden.
When a woman peers at the peaceful face of her companion during his slumber and plants a gentle kiss upon it, to convey her deep affection, it is referred to as the 'Kiss that Ignites Fondness'.
"When a woman gives her partner a playful peck when he is busy with work, or during a friendly debate, or when his attention is focused elsewhere - with the intention of shifting his focus, it is known as a 'distractive peck'."
When a friend returns home late at night and gently wakes up his dear companion, who has nodded off on her bed, to share his wish to play a game, it's known as the 'Wakeful Greeting'. On such occasions, the friend may pretend to remain asleep upon her friend's return to figure out his intentions and garner his respect.
When an individual gently pecks the likeness of their affectionate companion reflected in a mirror, on water, or on a wall, it is referred to as a 'gesture expressing intention'.
When an individual expresses affection to a child on his lap, or towards a picture, or an artwork, or a statue in front of the individual they hold dearly, it is referred to as a 'secondhand tenderness.'
In the evening at a local theatre or community gathering, a man approaches a woman to join in a playful camaraderie. If she is standing, he may gently tap a finger of her hand in a jovial showing of companionship. If she is seated, he may lightly touch the toe of her foot, letting her know he's arrived for the friendly game. 

Similarly, when a lady is playfully massaging a dear friendship's body for a lighthearted game like tickle-tickle, she may momentarily rest her cheek on his leg, perhaps pretending to be drowsy to lighten the mood. She may then tap his leg or big toe, indicating 'game on'. This is referred to as a ‘friendly demonstration'. It's a testament to their trust and playful bond, accompanying and enhancing their profound and wholesome friendship.
CHAPTER IV

This chapter encases the heart of our interaction strategies in the joyous game that adults play— teeming with healthy competition, exhilaration, mutual respect, and gentle engagement. It is a game that two full-fledged adults mutually indulge in, where the roles are switched playfully, and no score is kept. The game in itself is the journey and the destination—creating prized moments of companionship unique to the players.

Knowledge is the key to understanding this game's depth and width. It opens ways to sensitively navigate your opponent's mood, sentiments, and physical cues, enhancing the overall game experience. The proficiency lies not in winning but in comprehending how to participate seamlessly, making the game a riot of mirth and camaraderie.

The chapter earnestly details the importance of a virtuoso style of play, emphasizing the ease and deftness with which each move should be made—like feather brushing against velvet. It propounds the ingenious use of tender verbal codes and eloquent gestures over direct confrontation, adding to the spontaneous flavor of non-verbal communication.

Advice on etiquette, including the importance of consent and respecting the fellow player's comfort level, is also underscored. An enjoyable, relaxed playing field ensures optimal fun and nurtures a closer bonding amongst the players. 

It also provides healthful insights into the timing and energy levels to be considered while initiating the lively game. One should understand the ebb and flow of their own and their partner's energies to harmoniously co-ordinate and effectively plunge into this wholesome play.

Lastly, the chapter concludes with special instructions to enhance your gaming skills further, focusing on creating a conducive, uplifting, and joyful ambiance. This includes recommendations on suitable indoor and outdoor venues and on creating inviting spaces that stimulate positivity and encompass a delightful game ambiance. Furthermore, occasional usage of fragrant flowers, mild incense, soft lightings, and melodious tunes can invigorate the atmosphere and elevate the gaming experience to new soothing heights.

In all, this chapter earnestly encourages adults to engage, enjoy, and evolve through this friendly, wholesome game, thereby enriching their ethos of camaraderie and companionship.
ON GENTLY EXPRESSING AFFECTION, OR MAKING LOVING DOODLES, OR SOFTLY TICKLING WITH THE FINGERNAILS
When affection deepens, playful actions such as gentle tickling become commonplace, and they are practiced on these distinct occasions: upon the first friendly meeting; before embarking on a journey; upon return from traveling; at the moment when an upset friend reconciles their differences; and lastly, when the individual is overwhelmed with joy.
However, playing with a sense of gentle pressure is not commonly pursued except by those who are profoundly enthusiastic in the game. This method, used hand-in-hand with a friendly, playful nibble, is enjoyed by those who find the action pleasurable.
Marking with the fingernails involves eight different types, based on the different patterns created:
Title: The Playful Motions 
1. Harmonious Whistle
2. Welcoming Crescent
3. Affectionate Circle 
4. Friendly Straight Line 
5. Gliding Touch of a Tiger's Paw 
6. Soft Print of a Peacock's Feather 
7. Quick and Merry Leap of a Bunny
8. Calm Unfolding of a Blue Lotus Leaf

The areas of gentle play during this friendly game are the following: the comfort of the underarm, the serenity of the throat, the warmth of the heart region, the smile of the lips, the middle sections for tickling and laughter, and the strong limbs known as the thighs. However, Suvarnanabha advocates that when the flow of enjoyment is overflowing, the specific areas need not be considered.
The attributes of exemplary fingernails include their brightness, firmness, cleanliness, wholeness, slightly curved form, softness, and a shiny gloss. According to their size, fingernails can fall within one of three categories: Petite, Medium, or Ample.
Lengthy nails, which lend elegance to one's hands and magnetically draw the attention of others due to their aesthetic value, are a notable trait of the Bengalis.
Petite tokens, which can be utilized in diverse manners, are intended purely for the purpose of imparting joy, and are held by the inhabitants of the southern territories.
Moderate nails, demonstrating the attributes of both previously mentioned styles, are characteristic of the people of Maharashtra.
When one individual gently touches another's chin, chest, lower lip, or hip in such a way that leaves no scratch or mark, but merely raises goosebumps on the skin from the delight of the touch and the contact of nails, creating a subtle sound, it is referred to as 'echoing or imprinting with the fingernails'.
This playful interaction is common when a young lady's friend gives her a nurturing head massage, gently scratches her scalp, and teases her in a spirit of lighthearted amusement or mild pranking.
The impression of a curved mark with a gentle touch, drawn affectionately on the neck and chest, is known as 'the half moon'.
When the half-moon shaped prints are displayed facing each other, it's termed a 'circle'. This playful marking with fingers is generally made on the belly button, the small dips around the lower back, and on the bends of the legs.
A sign, shaped like a tiny stroke, which can be drawn on any body zone, is known as a 'line'.
This identical mark, when arching elegantly on the chest, is fondly referred to as 'a tiger's claw'.
When a fanciful outline is created on the canvas using five different paintbrushes, it's recognized as 'the peacock's feather'. This artistic expression seeks appreciation because it necessitates significant prowess to perfectly shape it.
When five tickles are given close to each other near the sides of the belly, this jovial interaction is known as "the leap of the bunny."
A sign drawn on one's chest or hips, shaped like the leaf of a blue lotus, is called the 'emblem of the blue lotus'.
When an individual is embarking on a journey, leaving a sign or a mark on an object like a notebook, or a keepsake, it is referred to as a 'memory charm'. During this nonchalant ritual, three or four lines are drawn closely together with a pen, as a friendly token of their relationship.
This concludes our section on play-marking with the use of hands. Just as there are endless variations of skill among individuals with this universally recognized activity, there are innumerable methods to make these playful marks. Because this type of friendly game is independent of romantic relationships, it stands to reason that no one can definitively count the myriad ways of play-marking that exist.

Vatsyayana observes that, as in life, variety is essential for these friendly games. This explains why those well-versed in a range of such playful games, like courtesans of old, are highly valued participants. If variety in skill is sought after in arts and diversions like archery, it stands to reason it should be sought even more in friendly games between adults.
Signs left from friendly games should not be made on married individuals. However, certain types of reminders can be shared between them, in their special moments, to reinforce their bond of love and companionship.
CHAPTER V:

The Adult's Wholesome Games

In this enchanting chapter, we dive into the delightful, playful world of games designed to foster emotional intimacy and understanding for adults. The beauty of these family-friendly, innocent activities lies not just in their amusement value but also in their ability to reinforce bonds that keep our sentiments knit together. 

Let's explore games in two different categories. The first set, the "Elixir of Emotion" games, implicate shared experiences, trust, and emotional openness. The second section, "Playtime Puzzles", includes enigmatic games which court intellectual engagement and problem-solving to connect on a deeper level. 

1. The Elixir of Emotion Games: 

a) "Whisper of Desires": In this amicable game, both persons sit close together, preferably in a serene environment. They alternately whisper their desires, wishes, or dreams into each other's ears. It may range from a simple desire for cozy late-night movie marathons to an adventurous road trip wishlist. This game is an excellent way to keep communication channels open and show acknowledgment of each other's aspirations. 

b) “Mirror, Mirror”: Participants face each other, mirroring each other's actions. The game allows adults to synchronize their movements, promoting a sense of unity and mutual understanding. 

2. The Playtime Puzzles:

a) "Riddler's Delight": A brain-teaser game where both parties take turns to solve riddles. It boosts cognitive skills, but more importantly, it generates laughs and a healthy competitive spirit. 

b) “Expedition of Enigmas”: Pull out the ol’ treasure map for this grand adventure. Create a puzzle trail for your partner to follow, filled with cryptic clues, eventually leading to a heartfelt gift or surprise.

Just like the original Kama Sutra, it's vital for both participants to be active players, ensuring an equal give and take. These games are fun and demonstrate that intimacy can be a source of joy, fosters mutual respect and the broadening of one's horizons. So, as you embrace these wholesome games in your routine, witness the harmony it brings to your life while keeping you youthful, engaged, and emotionally connected. 

Thus ends the mesmerizing Chapter V, bursting with heartwarming, wholesome games designed to infuse hordes of jubilant laughter and positive emotions into your adult relations!
ON TICKLING, AND THE MEANS TO BE EMPLOYED WITH REGARD TO FRIENDS FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES
ALL the places that can be delightfully tickled are also the areas where a playful nibble may be given, excluding the upper lip, the inner part of the mouth, and the eyes.
The characteristics of healthy teeth are as follows: They should be uniform, having a pleasant shine, amenable to whitening, proportionally aligned, intact, and with sharp, defined edges.
On the other hand, the disadvantages of teeth in this friendly, wholesome adult game can be that they might be dull, sticking out from the gums, uneven, soft, substantially large, and not firmly set.
The following are the various types of friendly nudges: The subtle nudge, The playful poke, The pinpoint, The dotted line, The coral and the gem, The string of gems, The scattered cloud, and The boar's nudge.
The playful nibble, only discernable by the blush it leaves on the skin, is also known as the 'secret nibble'.
When the skin is gently pressed on both sides, it is termed the 'plump hug'.
When a tiny section of the skin experiences a gentle squeeze between two teeth, it is referred to as the 'spot'.
"When little areas of the skin are gently nipped with all the teeth, it is known as the 'dotted line game'."
The friendly game, known as 'coral and the jewel,' comes into play when you bring together your teeth, called the jewel, and your lips, referred to as the coral, in the form of a good-natured mimicking action.
When using all your pearly whites in a friendly, playful nip, it is referred to as the 'string of pearls'.
This movement, which comprises uneven hops encircling and originates from the gaps of the teeth is known as 'broken cloud'. This is fondly demonstrated on each other's shoulders.
The move, which consists of many rows of playful tags near to one another, with cheerful moments in between, is known as the 'playful tag of a boar'. This is engaged in the areas of the shoulders and later, on the chest; these two particular interactions are unique to individuals who share a deep bond of affection.
The lower lip is where play such as 'surprise tickle,' 'gentle pinch,' and 'poke' occur, whereas the 'gentle pinch' and the 'pebble and seashell' play both ensue on the cheek. Friendly nuzzling, soft pressing with the fingertips, and playful nips are the embellishments of the left cheek. Anytime the word ‘cheek’ is mentioned, it is to be deciphered as the left cheek.
"Both the 'trail of polka dots' and the 'pathway of gems' are to be traced on the neck, underarm, and junction of the legs; however, only the 'trail of polka dots' should be traced on the forehead and the legs."
The gentle touch with fingertips, and the playful nibbling of the following objects - a frontlet on the forehead, an ornament worn on the ear, a bouquet of flowers, a fragrant bay leaf, or a sprig of the sweet-scented tamala plant, - gracing the beloved woman, are signs of the desire for joyful interactions.
This concludes the various forms of friendly nibbling.
In matters of the heart, one should endeavor to perform actions that bring joy and happiness to people from various cultures and walks of life.
The ladies of the central regions (i.e., between the Ganges and the Jumna) are esteemed for their noble dispositions, unaccustomed to dishonourable practices, and have a distaste for excessive nail-trimming and biting.
In the province of Balhika, women are won over through the act of striking...a friendly match of a game.
The women of Avantika are fond of unusual activities and can sometimes lack etiquette.
The women of Maharashtra are enthusiasts of the sixty-four games, they enjoy expressing themselves in a softer yet firm tone, and appreciate being addressed in a similar manner. They possess a fervent love for enjoyable pastimes.
The ladies from Pataliputra, also known as the current Patna, share similar characteristics with the ladies from Maharashtra. Their preferences and interests, however, are often shared subtly and privately.
Women from the Dravida region, even when engaged in the adult's engaging game, rich with affectionate hugs and tender squeezes, have a gentle tempo, meaning they take their time in this friendly interaction.
The women of Vanavasi are filled with the joy of living, experiencing every sort of wholesome amusement and covering their bodies with modest attire. They stand tall against those who engage in unkind, offensive, and harsh discourse.
The women of Avanti dislike the game of kissing, marking with the nails, and biting, but they have a preference for partaking in diverse kinds of friendly adult games.
The women of Malwa enjoy warm hugs and friendly kisses, but not rough play. They are drawn toward gentle taps and playful nudges.
The wonderful women of Abhira, along with those from the regions surrounding the Indus and Five Rivers, commonly known as Punjab, enjoy partaking in the Auparishtaka or the friendly, social discourse game.
The ladies of Aparatika are brimming with enthusiasm and gently utter the word 'Sit'.
The ladies of the Lat region display incredible enthusiasm, and they even have a unique phrase, 'Sit', which reflects their loud and lively spirit.
The women of the land of Stri Rajya, and of Koshola (Oude), are filled with robust vitality, their energy is immense, and they delight in taking tonics and herbs that enhance their already abundant zest for life.
The women of the Andhra region possess delicate constitutions, they have an affinity for merriment, and take pleasure in indulgences of comfort and joy.
The women of Ganda have gentle figures and communicate with delightful charm.
Now, Suvarnanabha believes that what is pleasing to an individual's nature holds more significance than what pleases an entire nation. Hence, he proposes that the individual peculiarities should not be overlooked in favor of national tendencies. Diverse forms of enjoyable pursuits, styles of dress, and entertaining games of one nation are often borrowed by another over time. In these instances, they should be acknowledged as originally belonging to the borrowed nation.
Among the activities previously listed, such as hugging, pecking and so on, those that intensify mutual affection should be prioritized, while those that solely serve for fun or variety should follow.
CHAPTER VI

Brimming with joy, laughter, camaraderie, and connection, the sixth realm of our game shares yet another exciting and heartwarming chapter of friendly companionship.

Just as in a joyful game of chess, strategic moves filled with anticipation and thought can add spark to the game's grandeur. This chapter emphasizes the importance of compliments and ego-boosting utterances to stimulate a joyful atmosphere between the participants. Every kind word, every adoring sentence, and those little pearls of praises we share can light up the smiles of our playing partners.

There are many ways we can communicate these compliments. A simple "Your laughter is my most favorite tune" could uplift the spirit; a "Looking at you, I see a reflection of grace and talent" is a subtle way to express admiration.

Sharing meals, exchanging thoughts on your favorite books, or joyfully discussing shared passions can bring an unexpected closeness between two participants. You'll find that these bonding activities add a special flavor to your friendly game.

Physical contact, such as a warm handshake, a friendly high-five, or an amicable pat on the back, can become playful symbols of cheer and friendship. These little gestures always bring out the essence of a deeper bond.

At last, the chapter concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding. Understanding your fellow player—their likes, dislikes, dreams, and fears—adds depth to your relationship, producing a harmonious and enjoyable game.

Chapter VI, thus, predominantly celebrates the interactions, connections, and the pure joy derived from shared activities. As you proceed, may your game be engrossed in smiles, filled with laughter, and truly reflect the spirit of camaraderie!
ON THE VARIOUS TECHNIQUES OF RESTING AND MULTIFACETED TYPES OF ENGAGEMENTS 

Throughout our adult lives, we encounter an assortment of occasions requiring different forms of participation and rest. This chapter discusses these varied methods and unites us all in our inherent human journey.

**Lying Down Techniques**

Just as our interactions are multitudinous, so are the ways we lie down. For water holds different forms as it adapts to the vessel that contains it, so do we morph into the environment laid for our rest. 

The "Starfish" method requires lying flat on one's back, limbs outstretched, absorbing the space's energy. The "Cocoon" involves curling up tightly on one side, protecting oneself from the world's uncertainty. The "Yearner" suggests lying on one's side with arms stretched forward, reaching out to grasp the corners of dreams. The variety is there for everyone to explore and find the one that snugly fits their comfort and needs.

**Various Types of Engagements**

1. **The Communal Affair** - This is a group activity that involves a collective effort to reach a common goal. Board games or cooking meals together are common examples. In such engagements, everyone plays their roles, as a team attempting to win the game or make a meal.

2. **The Tête-à-tête** - These are intimate engagements between two adults, much like a game of chess or a heartwarming conversation. They allow a level of connection and understanding that is personal and profound.

3. **The Solitary Pursuit** - These engagements welcome the tranquillity of solitude, like reading a book or practicing meditation. Here, the focus is on self-development and personal growth.

Remember, every engagement is a friendly game that adults play, a dance of cooperation, understanding, and shared experiences. The context and rules may vary, but the ultimate aim remains the same – to connect, learn and grow in harmony while sharing joy and happiness with others. So, embrace the diversity, explore the various methods of rest and types of engagements, and embark on a journey full of enriching experiences.
During a particularly energetic round of the game, participants should remember the 'Great Deer' pose, where one member of the duo becomes more receptive to the whims of the friend, ensuring broad and dynamic movements. In contrast, during the 'Gentle Elephant' round, occupation of a smaller, more compact play space is recommended. Nevertheless, in an 'Equal Exchange' round, both parties should settle into natural and comfortable roles. 

These tips mentioned regarding the 'Great Deer' and the 'Gentle Elephant' also apply to the 'Swift Horse' version of the game. Notably, during the 'Gentle Elephant' round, the participant tasked with the smaller area should make proactive use of barriers and buffers, ensuring that personal energy is preserved and the game duration is fairly distributed.
The Doe-like Lady adopts the following three stances in her merry game: The Broad Embrace, The Relaxed Repose, and The Indra's Spouse's Pose.
When she makes a bridge-like figure with her body, it is known as the 'arched gate stance'. In such moments, the other player should make use of game utilities, such as a smooth playing card, to ensure an easy game progression.
When she exercises by stretching and widely separating her thighs in a playful activity with her partner, this is fondly termed as the 'yawning position'.
When she positions her thighs with her legs folded on top of them towards her sides, and thus initiates the wholesome game, it is called the pose of Indrani. It is a technique taught only through practice and interaction. This position is equally beneficial while engaging in the 'highest game'.
The 'clasping game' is utilized in 'gentle play', and in the 'softest play', along with the 'pressing game', the 'twining game', and the 'mare's game'.
When the legs of both the adults are outstretched concurrently over one another, this friendly game is called the 'linking pose'. There are a couple of variations to this game: the sideways variation and the reclining variation, based on how they choose to position themselves. In the sideways play, the adult should ideally sit on his left side, encouraging his partner to do the same but on her right side. This guide should be followed in all circumstances, no matter whom you're playing this wholesome game with.
When the friendly game commences in a hugging posture, and one adult gently squeezes their companion with their legs, it is named the 'hugging squeeze game'.
When the woman drapes one of her legs over the leg of her friend during a playful round of friendly adult games, it's fondly referred to as the 'interlocking stance'.
When a lady firmly grasps in her hand the marker during the enjoyable adult game, it is known as 'the mare's move'. It's a skill acquired only through practice and is most commonly played by women in the Andhra region.
The aforementioned styles of relaxing and lounging are highlighted by Babhravya. Suvarnanabha, on the other hand, provides the following supplements:
When the individual lifts both of their legs upright, this is known as the 'Elevated Stance'.
When she lifts both of her legs and playfully rests them on her game partner's shoulders, it is referred to as the 'stretching stance'.
When the legs are bent and gently embraced by the friend in their front, it is referred to as the 'comforting hug'.
When one of her legs is extended fully, it forms the 'semi-extended posture.'
When one player rests a leg on the other player's shoulder, extending the other leg outwards, then swapping positions and continuing alternately, this engaging move is known as 'The Bamboo Branch Dance'.
When one of her legs is positioned over the shoulder and the other is gently extended, it is referred to as 'establishing a balance'. This maneuver can only be mastered through consistent playful practice.
In what we refer to as the 'crab's pose,' both of the person's legs are gently folded and placed on their middle, much like the compact stance of a beach crab.
When the legs are lifted and gently rested atop each other, this is known as the 'stacked arrangement'.
When the legs are crossed over one another, it's known as the 'lotus-style arrangement'.
When a player, during an interactive game, pivots and engages with their partner without releasing their hold, while the partner encircles them warmly from behind all the while, it is termed the 'pivot maneuver'. This move is typically mastered over time through persistent practice.
Thus, Suvarnanabha suggests, these various positions of reclining, sitting, and standing should be practiced in water, as it lends itself to easy movement. However, Vatsyayana disagrees, believing that playing games in water is not suitable, as it is considered inappropriate by certain societal principles.
When two individuals lean on each other's frame or a nearby wall or pillar, and thus establish a playful interaction whilst upright, it is referred to as the 'supported play'.
When a person leans against a wall for support and another person sits on their interconnected hands, like a playful, spontaneous swing. The seated person wraps their arms around the neck of the standing person, their thighs resting gently by the standing person's waist. The seated person propels themself by lightly pushing against the wall that the standing person is leaning on. This delightful and energetic interaction is known as the 'Elevated Embrace'.
In the friendly game that adults indulge in, there's a hilarious scenario called 'gentle moo-moo's meeting'. The woman pretends to be like a calf, balancing playfully on her hands and feet as though she's frolicking through a grassy field. Meanwhile, the man becomes a pretend bull, mimicking the charge of a bovine friend. Normally, adults would play a teasing game on the front side such as playing tag or patty-cake, but during this light-hearted game, they switch it to the back, adding an unexpected twist to keep their playtimes exciting.
In this joyful game, participants can playfully imitate the movements of various animals. The scampering of a dog, the bleats and bounds of a goat, the gentle prancing of a deer, the steadfast stride of a donkey, the nimbleness of a cat, the pouncing of a tiger, the hefty shuffle of an elephant, the diligent digging of a boar, and the galloping of a horse. Each player is encouraged to wholeheartedly embody the characteristics of these different animals in their merry display.
When an individual enjoys quality time with two other individuals at the same time, all of whom share mutual fondness for each other, it is referred to as the 'unified gathering'.
When an individual engages with many friends at once, it is referred to as 'the gathering of a friendly herd.'
The following varieties of fun-filled activities - at play in water, or the playful bonding of one elephant with many other elephants, reportedly only observed in aquatic environments, the playful interactions within a group of goats, the playful interactions within a assembly of deer - are exercises inspired by these joyous creaturely gatherings.
Within the realm of Gramaneri, numerous young adults find enjoyment in the company of a woman who may be the friend of one of them, either individually or as a group. In this manner, one of them might engage her in a hearty conversation, while another keeps her entertained with jokes, a third one might challenge her in a friendly game of charades, yet another might engage her in a cooperative board game. In this way, they all get to mutually experience the joy of her various interests and hobbies, in no fixed order.
The same activities can be enjoyed when a group of friends are spending time in the company of one individual, or when one individual finds themselves in the company of many friends. Similarly, this can also be replicated by the ladies of the royal court when they unexpectedly find themselves in the company of a single gentleman.
In the Southern regions, there exists a popular game among adults known as the 'lower congress'.
CHAPTER VII

In this delightful chapter, we journey into a realm of fun, engaging, and interactive games real adults play. Like in every worthwhile pastime, the joy derived from these games nurtures camaraderie, mutual respect, and emotional understanding between players.

As we explore this wonderland, we identify those games that necessitate two players and the dynamics unique to it. A gentle reminder that with these games, success doesn't come from a place of dominance, but from a shared appreciation of play, laughter, and goodwill.

Our first delightful game is named "The Whispered Secret". This game necessitates close proximity, perfect for strengthening that bond between players. The player "whisperer" shares a secret or jokes in the ear of the other player without the surrounding folks catching a whisper of it. This really tests the whispering prowess and the listening skills.

An engaging game to follow is "Echoing Giggles". Each player takes turns telling funny anecdotes or jokes, and the goal is to make the other player chuckle or even better, burst into genuine laughter. This game is wonderful for creating that spark of joy and light-heartedness.

And lastly, there is "The Cuddle Puddle". It is a warm and cozy game for cold days, where players bundle up next to each other, wrapped in a comfortable blanket, sharing stories of past triumphs, dreams, hopes, and fears. The objective of this game is, again, not an extent of authority over each other but to immerse oneself in the comforting presence of the other while sharing a friendly atmosphere and building trust. 

This chapter's aim is to guide adults in fostering deeper connections with each other via these endearing games. Remember - the purpose here is not competition or distinction, but rather to stimulate love, trust, respect, and to strengthen emotional bonds between players. Happy playing!
ABOUT THE DIFFERENT WAYS OF PLAYING, AND THE SOUNDS THAT SUIT THEM
The playful activity of affection can be likened to a friendly debate, due to the dynamic nature of love and its inclination towards amicable disagreements. The stage for this love-filled game is the body, where certain places have a stronger impact: The shoulders, The head, The area between the heartbeats, The back, The middle part of the body, and The sides.
Contact involves four kinds: High-five with the back of the hand, Tip-tapping with slightly curled fingers, Fist-bumping, and Slap-n-clapping with the open palm of the hand.
Given its nature to cause discomfort, tagging elicits a variety of vocal responses, ranging from playful squeals to eight different types of laughter.
The Utterance Hin: The echoing sound of a friendly competition, The gentle hum of harmonious interaction, The emotional whisper of a heartfelt game, The utterance Phut, a sudden exclamation of surprise in play, The sound Phat, a triumphant declaration in the game, The phrase Sut, an expression of jovial camaraderie, and The sound Plat, the cheerful proclamation of game's closure.
In addition to these, there exists language laden with meaning, such as the warm utterance of "mother," and expressions that embody restriction, adequacy, yearning for freedom, discomfort or commendation. To this roster, incorporate the endearing sounds of friendly creatures like the dove, the cuckoo, the green pigeon, the parrot, the bee, the sparrow, the flamingo, the duck, and the quail, which are occasionally harnessed to enhance the playful atmosphere.
Playful nudges should be given to the back of your fellow player when she is seated on your lap, and in return, she may playfully nudge back, acting like she is indignantly amused, and making sounds like a pigeon and melodramatic sniffles. As the game intensifies, gentle tapping between her collarbones with the back of your hand is suggested. This should start off softly and gradually increase in rhythm matching the escalating fun and excitement until the culmination of the game.
During this part of the friendly game, adults may use playful sounds like "Hin" or others, as they prefer or are accustomed. When the man, with his fingers loosely linked, gently taps the woman on the head, echoing the fun-filled sound of "Phat," it's called Prasritaka, a term for tapping with loosely linked fingers. At this point, the joyous sounds of cooing, the echoed "Phat" and a muffled "Phut" may be heard, much like a soft ping-pong ball meeting the water surface. As the game begins with friendly kisses, the woman responds with a playful hissing sound. 

Amid the excitement of the game, if the woman is unfamiliar with the friendly taps, she might repeat words of gentle reminder or wish for pause, intertwined with words of affection like 'dad', 'mom', in between sounds of light sighs, soft cries and playful roars.

As the game arrives at its conclusion, the man can softly press against the woman's shoulders, sides and lower back with open palms, applying light pressure until the end. Following this, the room may fill with sounds resembling those of the quail or the goose, ending the game on a note of lighthearted fun.

CHAPTER: ABOUT PERSONS PLAYING EACH OTHER'S ROLES; AND THE ACTS OF COOPERATION

In this reflectively playful world, where fun plays a paramount role, adults often engage in a fascinating activity of role switching. This dynamic game requires imagination and empathy, as one takes on the actions generally associated with the other.

This game's purpose isn't just to widen the experience spectrum of the participants but to also build a bridge of understanding and cooperation, thereby strengthening the bond between the players. It becomes an adventure, an enlightening journey as they explore the nuances of what it feels like to take the role of the other.

When one takes up the task usually meant for the other, it's here that the wholesome game of cooperation truly begins. This brings about an understanding of the efforts involved in the tasks mostly taken for granted.

Engaging in this delightful switching of roles thus allows for a deeper level of connection and mutual respect. It also replenishes the fun factor in the game, bringing joyful learning and shared laughter. 

In conclusion, 'role switching' and 'acts of cooperation' may seem like simple playful strategies yet they are much more. They teach compassion, understanding, appreciating each other's effort and most importantly, brings about a strong sense of unity during the gameplay, making it a memorable and valuable life lesson.
WHEN a woman notices that her playmate is exhausted from continuous play, without having his pursuit of amusement fully met, she should, with his consent, let him relax on a cozy mat, and lend a hand by partaking in his role. She may also engage in this to fulfill her friend's natural sense of curiosity, or her own desire for a change of pace.
There are two methods of conducting this activity; the first is when, during a friendly game, she takes the initiative, spins around, and climbs atop her companion in such a way that the game continues without any hindrance to its enjoyment. The other is when she leads the game from the outset. Then, with flowers adorning her loose hair and her laughter punctuated by short breaths, she playfully nudges her companion's chest with her own, routinely lowering her head in amusement. She should mimic the fun and engagement her partner usually brings to the match, merrily returning playful jabs and teasing him, proclaiming, 'You challenged me and tired me out with this intense game, so now it is my turn to challenge you.' Then she should express her own shyness, tiredness, and her wish to pause the friendly competition. Thus, she joyfully assumes the role typically taken by her partner, proceeding with the entertaining bearings of the game as will be detailed shortly.
Whatever actions a gentleman takes to bring joy to a lady are termed as the gentleman's endeavors, and these are as follows:
While the woman is comfortably settled on his couch, utterly engrossed in the flow of the conversation, he should gently unfasten the bow of her hair ribbon, and when she starts to playfully scold him, he should shower her with affectionately planted kisses. Then, when his excitement and anticipation rise, he should engage her with his hands in a friendly game of tickle and caress, delighting in her laughter and smiles. 

If the woman is shy, perhaps it being the first time they have engaged in such a friendly exchange, the man should guide his hands gently in warm spaces, likely cocooned between her folded legs. And if she is a bright-eyed young girl, he should respectfully approach her complexities, perhaps beginning with the soft curve of shoulders covered by the curtain of her hair or the plump sweetspot of her cheeks that she might hide blushingly behind her gentle hands, even under the umbrella of her arm or the nape of her neck. 

However, if she is a seasoned woman, well-versed in this dance of warmth and laughter, he should do whatever brings joy and comfort to the both of them, and whatever suits the mirth of their delightful evening. 

After this delicate dance, he should playfully tug at her hair, or frame her chin with his fingers with the aim of planting another peck of affection on her. If she is a young girl, she might shy away and close her eyes. Regardless, the man should read the woman's response, intuitively learning what actions would bring her twinkling delight in their continuing congenial contest.
Here Suvarnanabha conveys that while an adult is enjoying a friendly game with a woman, he should always take extra care to interact with those areas of her body towards which she is directing her attention.
The signs of a woman's enjoyment and fulfillment in the game are as follows: her body becomes light and relaxed, she closes her eyes as she savors the moment, shedding all her inhibitions. She displays increased enthusiasm to merge her playing piece with her partner’s as closely as possible. 

On the contrary, the signs of her lack of enjoyment and dissatisfaction in the game could manifest in various ways: she may wave her hands in frustration, prevent her partner from stepping back, appear despondent, playfully nudge her teammate, and even show signs of a friendly spat. 

She may continue to engage in game moves after her partner has already finished his turn. In such instances, her partner should gently encourage her, in the same way as the tender touch of an elephant’s trunk, until she finds her rhythm again. Only then should he proceed to place his game piece alongside hers.

The tasks to be performed by the adult are: Progressing, Generating warmth and affection through wholesome interactions, Engaging intensively in a safe, fun-filled activity, Fostering connections, Applying healthy influence and persuasion, Formulating a surprise, The playful interaction inspired by a boar, The friendly contest reminiscent of a bull, and The fluttery merriment akin to a sparrow's frolic.
When the game pieces are strategically placed together in an accurate and forward manner, it is referred to as 'advancing the game piece accurately'.
When the ping pong paddle is held in the hand and turned all round in a game of table tennis, it is known as 'spinning'.
When the target is positioned lower and the top area is strategically hit with the playing piece, it is termed 'Piercing.'
When the same action is performed on the lower region of the game zone, it is called 'Enhancing the Play'.
When the circle is engaged with the marker for a long time, it is referred to as 'prolonged engagement'.
When the puzzle piece is moved some distance away from its corresponding spot, and then skillfully slipped into its place, it is called 'making a successful match'.
When only a section of the sandbox is played with using a toy shovel, it is often referred to as the 'Boar's Sweep'.
"When both sides of the miniature game board are swiped tenderly, it's known as 'the buffalo touch.'"
"When the game token is on the home base, and moved back and forth a lot without being removed, it is known as 'sparrow's play'. This happens in the final moments of a friendly, wholesome adult game."

When a woman takes on the role traditionally led by a man, she has the following extra activities to engage in addition to the previous nine: The pair of salad tongs, The spinning top, and The garden swing.
When the woman grasps the flagpole with her hoop, pulls it in closer, squeezes it gently, and keeps it securely within her hoop for an extended duration, it is affectionately termed 'the snug pair of tongs.'
When, while partaking in the game, she spins round and round in lively motion, it is fondly named the 'carousel'. This move can only be mastered through wholesome, playful repetition.
On such a lively moment, when the man elevates the central part of his body, and the woman rotates her midpoint, it is called the 'merry-go-round'.
"When the player gets weary during the game, she should gently rest her forehead upon her good sport playmate, and enjoy a brief reprieve without interrupting the exciting match underway. After regaining their stamina, the other player is then given the signal to resume the wholesome game."
CHAPTER IX

In this chapter, we intend to explore the captivating art of mutual playfulness between grown-ups, the kind of playfulness that strengthens bonds, enhances emotional understanding, and brings a sense of joy and fulfillment. Just like how children experience joy, comfort, and learn through playful actions, adults too can rekindle their bonds and experience their love in a new light through this gentle game of affection and admiration. 

The More Delightful Game:
In this game, two grown-ups deeply devoted to each other stand face-to-face and engage in the dance of mutuality, guided by the rhythm of their heartbeats and the serene tunes of love. Tenderly, one person reaches out to touch the other's face with utmost admiration; invariably, this warms the bonds between them, resulting in a profound sense of harmony.

The Pleasurable Union:
This game varies in pace; sometimes it could be a slow harmony and at other times, a passionate dance. The purpose isn't to compete or win but to comprehend, connect, reciprocate each other's feelings, and dissolve in each other's affection.

The Enthralling Embrace:
As the game progresses, they embrace each other in warmth and affection, showcasing the unity between them. It's an expression of their connection and their longing to comfort and support each other even in times of distress.

The Joyous Interchange:
As they converse in silent language, they also embark on a serene journey of exchanging emotions, desires, dreams, and hopes. It is a mode of communication that goes beyond mere words; it allows them to understand each other better, promoting mutual respect and empathy.

The Gentle Whisper:
There are no mandatory rules or restrictions for this game. It is typically conducted in an ambiance imbued with tranquility. A game does not always need boisterous laughter or loud cheers. Sometimes, the soft whispering of sweet nothings in each other's ears, accompanied by gentle giggles, can be far more exhilarating.

In conclusion, this game, when played with transparency, mutual respect, and love, ultimately strengthens bonds, opens channels for better communication, or simply imbues your day with a shared, joyous experience. It's a reminder that expressing love and affection isn't confined to any rules or limitations and that every moment shared with your loved ones is precious and worthy of celebration.
ON THE ART OF FRIENDLY CONVERSATION AND VERBAL CONNECTION
There are two types of performance artists, those who play roles of males, and those who play roles of females. Performers in the role of females adopt their style, speech, gestures, gentleness, shyness, innocence, softness, and bashfulness. The manners that are typically associated with females, are exceptionally performed by these artists, and this is referred to as Auparishtaka. These artists derive their joy and livelihood from this kind of performance, and they live lives the way actors do, embodying these different roles. Such is the way of performers who play roles as females.
Undercover jesters disguised as adults keep their intentions hidden, and when they hope to start a fun game, they lead the life of masseurs. Under the guise of a relaxing massage, a jester of this sort will pat and draw his hands close to the calf muscles of the person he is massaging. After this, he touches the knees and center parts of his client’s body. 

Then, if he finds the person is relaxed and ready for tickles, he lightly presses the person's feet and playfully teases him for being ticklish. If, after this, and after understanding his intentions, the person does not tell the jester to start the tickle game, then the jester initiates it of his own accord and begins the playful activity. 

However, if he is asked by the person to start the game, he pretends to argue with him, only conceding after making a playful fuss, adding an enjoyable sense of suspense to the game.
The following eight wholesome activities are then performed by the adult, one after the other: The miniature congress, Nibbling on the sides of a cookie, Pressing a comfortable pillow, Squeezing the soft furnishing, Sharing a friendly peck, Polishing a jewel, Savoring a mango fruit, and Fully consuming a delightful meal.
At the conclusion of each game, the companion suggests a pause, but when one undertaking wraps up, the adult beckons him to start another. After that game is complete, the subsequent one begins, then the next one, continuing in this manner.
When holding the game piece in his grasp and placing it on the game board, the player usually maneuvers it around, this is referred to as the 'friendly interaction'.
When holding the hand-end of the feathery wand with their fingers, bunched together like a newly blossomed bud, a player grazes the wand's edges with their lips, lightly employing their teeth as well, it is known as 'the Bud Nibble'.
When prompted to carry on, the participant gently presses the end of the game piece with their lips pursed together, showing affections as if pulling it away, this is deemed as 'external pressing'.
When, being invited to proceed, he brings the paper plane deeper into his mouth, clamps it between his lips and then releases it, it's referred to as the 'internal grip'.
When, holding the friendship token in his hand, the player appreciates it as if savoring a beloved keepsake, it is known as 'embrace recognition'.
When, after giving it a friendly kiss, he tickles it with his tongue all around, and smoothly slides his tongue over its tip, it is called a 'playful nudge'.
When he gently places half of it into his mouth, playfully nibbles on it, and enjoys its delicious, juicy flavor, this is known as 'savoring a mango fruit'.
Finally, with the agreement of the adult, the person places the entirety of the board game piece into their hand, grasping it from its start to its very end, as though they are preparing to box it all up anew, this move is called 'closing the game'.
Playful activities, such as engaging in a game of tag, having a friendly nail painting competition, or participating in other forms of harmonious exchanges, can also be incorporated during these kinds of wholesome gatherings.
The Auparishtaka is also engaged in by women of spirited and vivacious character, female helpers and serving maids, i.e., those who are not hitched to anybody, but who thrive through providing massages and muscle relaxation services.
The ancient and wise authors, known as the Acharyas, believe that the game Auparishtaka is more akin to a game dogs would play, rather than humans. This stems from their view that it's a rather frivolous activity, going against the guidance of ancient teachings. They point out that individuals themselves could also potentially face discomfort from involving others in their game who may not have the proper finesse. 

However, Vatsyayana argues that ancient teachings may not necessarily guide those who simply wish to enjoy a friendly competition with willing participants, and the rules strictly discourage the play of the game Auparishtaka with those already committed to a partner in life. Any potential discomfort faced by the players can easily be remedied and should not deter from the friendly spirit of the game.
In the eastern regions of India, folks generally avoid playing the Auparishtaka game with women.
The individuals of Ahichhatra engage with such women, but refrain from any verbal exchanges.
The folks in Saketa choose to engage these ladies in every form of oral discourse, while the denizens of Nagara refrain from this but engage in every other form of healthy interaction and stimulating adventures.
In the playful region of Shurasena, which rests on the southern bank of the Jumna, every game is gracefully accepted. For they believe that, as humans, we all carry an innate unpredictability that presses questions on our virtues, our conduct, our activities, our trust, or even our conversations. However, these ambiguities do not make an individual less deserving of love and trust because their cultural wisdom, served as a guiding beacon, reminds them about the inherent purity in all beings.

For instance, the milk of a cow, extracted delicately and for nourishment, is considered wholesome. Though the mouth of the cow, and even that of her calf, may be treated with caution due to cultural norms. Similarly, a dog is seen as a companion when he successfully catches a toy during a game, yet a treat stolen by him from the table is frowned upon. When a bird playfully nips  at a fruit, letting it tumble from the tree, this act is appreciated. However, food left over from a crow's feast is traditionally treated sceptically. Moreover, a friendly peck on the cheek as a social greeting is considered quite wholesome and acceptable in this culture.

Vatsyayana, the cultural philosopher, suggests that in all interactions related to affection and love, each person should act according to the customs of their community and their own personal disposition.

There are likewise these engaging rhymes to add flavor to the theme:
Certain adults revel in a friendly game of 'Speak-easy' with their close friends, or even their loyal associates. This game is driven by a profound familiarity and trust, offering a safe space and an opportunity to communicate deeply and fully with one another. In their private quarters, some individuals may play this verbal exchange game with their chosen companions, taking turns to voice their thoughts and feelings.

Equally, it is sometimes practiced among circles of close friends who have built a firm foundation of trust, understanding and respect. This verbal communication game represents a bond of friendship, love, and mutual honor. The rules of this game are simple: one person speaks about ideas or shares stories while the other listens attentively, reciprocating when it’s their turn.

This fascinating game often takes on intriguing formats. For instance, there is what's known as the "Crow's Nest" setup. This involves a player lying with their head towards the feet of their partner and vice versa, engaging in earnest conversation, mirroring the togetherness and symbiotic existence of crows. This unique posture underscores the intertwined nature of their bond while enjoying their wholesome game together.
For reasons we may never fully understand, there are those who choose the company of individuals of ill-repute, such as those tied to menial labor, while abandoning the articulate, generous friends who possess exceptional personal qualities. Talking over meals, an activity that requires a certain level of finesse and manners, should not be taken lightly by esteemed individuals such as scholars, ministers who are instrumental to the state's operations or those bearing great social standing. Although the gauging of palatable tastes, strength and nutritive value of certain conversational topics is endorsed in many cultural scriptures, it does not mean that every opinion should be shared with everyone.   

There are appropriate times, spaces and people that should be considered whilst deciding what topics to bring up at the table. One must judiciously discern the relevance of the topic, the appropriateness of the timing and the nature of the company. Therefore, one may opt to express or withhold their views depending on these factors. 

It is crucial, however, to remain mindful of the changing and capricious nature of people's thoughts and emotions. Things shared in secret often remain mysterious and confounding. It is nearly impossible to anticipate one's actions at any given moment or predict their intents. Each individual gameplay in this wholesome adult game of conversations thus remains ever exciting and unpredictable.

Chapter Title: THE COURSE OF FRIENDLY GATHERINGS: START AND FINISH. VARIOUS ASPECTS OF SOCIAL GAMES AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION IN LOVE

This chapter deals with the amiable conduct of peaceful and joyful gatherings, the different sorts of social games, and the ways to resolve conflicts arising from love.

The social gatherings are where adults convene to engage in mature conversation, enjoy good food, share stories, and play harmless games. These games vary in scale, from small circle games like charades, Pictionary, and trivia, to larger group activities like storytelling and musical chairs. The goal of these games is not competition, but bonding, interaction, and the unification of all present.

It's a time of harmony, giving the opportunity to explore each other's worlds, exchanging views, discussing various interests, and even extending the bond of friendship. The individual uniqueness is respected and well appreciated, with everyone taking the time to listen and understand. 

When the time to conclude the meeting arrives, it should be a ritual as equally elegant and meaningful as the initiation. Everyone should express their gratitude, share their insightful experiences from the session, and voice their eagerness for the next gathering. An atmosphere of warmth, positive energy, and anticipation for the future should be created.

Nonetheless, it's natural during these gatherings or games that disagreements might arise, particularly those stemming from fondness. These are love quarrels, conflicts that stem from a place of caring. It's crucial for these quarrels to be resolved tactfully and amicably, acknowledging the feelings and viewpoints of all parties involved. Patience, kindness, and respect should be the guiding principles in such situations.

As humans, we have a natural tendency to perceive the world in different ways. Thus, it's essential to understand that conflict is inevitable but can be resolved with communication, understanding, and respect for the other's perspectives. Our objective is to work towards a harmonious, joyful, and loving atmosphere in these gatherings.

This is the virtuous way of initiating, participating in, and concluding friendly gatherings, the different types of enjoyable games adults play, and the sensible act of resolving 'love quarrels,' differences that arise from strong bonds. It's a part of the dynamic, emotional experiences that enhance and nurture our relationships.
Within the Joy Room, adorned with delicate blooms and fragrant with captivating scents, amidst friends and helpers, the host should greet the lady guest, who arrives meticulously groomed and attired. He should extend an offer for light refreshments and a variety of soothing beverages at leisure. 

Next, he should courteously guide her towards the seat on his left, acknowledging the grace of her hairstyle and subtly highlighting the unique knot and hem of her dress, he can gently embrace her with a friendly right-handed hug. The ambiance should then be amplified with spirited banter on an array of topics. They can delicately touch upon topics which might conventionally be regarded as a tad too brash or not usually broached in casual conversation.

They may then fill the room with the melody of songs, perhaps enacted with miming gestures or not, and performances on various musical instruments might follow. They can eagerly discuss the fine arts while gently prompting each other to indulge in more beverages. 

Finally, when the lady guest becomes overwhelmed with affection and emotional warmth, the host should politely request the personnel around him to take their leave, offering them tokens of appreciation such as flowers, soothing balms and gifts of betel leaves. When the pair are finally left to their own devices, they can proceed as they wish, crafting an atmosphere of camaraderie and mutual comfort as has been narrated in the preceding chapters.
Such marks the beginning of a friendly game between adults. Once concluded, the two participants, bound by respect and humility, must move to separate washing rooms without their eyes meeting each other. This ritual initiates the next phase of the game, following which they return to their respective positions, taking this opportunity to savor the flavor of fresh betel leaves.

Then comes the next stage which involves artistic body painting. The participant applies onto the body of their partner, a soothing layer of pure sandalwood paste or any other material of choice, with careful, personal strokes. 

The subsequent ritual comes with a tinge of romance, where the gentleman envelops his partner with his left arm, using pleasing words to encourage her to sip from a cup he holds. Alternately, he may simply offer her a peaceful drink of water.

Moving on, the players then relish a delightful array of sweetmeats or anything of their liking, savoring juices fresh off the squeeze, hearty soups, enticing gruels, meat extracts, refreshing sherbets or sweet, pulpy mango juice. They may also try a delectable mixture of citron juice combined with sugar or any locally available, preferred delicacies that promise to deliver a soft, sweet and pure taste of indulgence.

In a cool moonlit night, the game may progress to the terrace of the palace or house. They get to enjoy the serene beauty of the night sky while engaging in lively, lighthearted conversation. 

Moreover, at this time, while the woman leisurely reclines in his lap, her face illuminated by the moon, the gentleman can draw her attention to the mesmerizing celestial bodies - the different planets, the morning star, the never-wandering polar star, and the constellation, the Great Bear. This is yet another layer to their friendly, yet profound game.
This concludes the chapter on friendly adult playtime.
Understanding of friendship is of the following kinds: Friendly love, Friendship that grows over time, Love fostered artificially, Love transferred from other friendships, Friendship like that of close confidants, Tricky friendships, and Spontaneous friendships.
When an individual and his or her beloved, who have been nurturing affection towards each other over a period, finally unite after overcoming numerous challenges or following a long separation - perhaps due to a journey or a disagreement that has been resolved, this friendly game is referred to as the 'loving game'. It is played in accordance to the preferences of the partners, and for as long as they find joy and contentment in it.
When two individuals meet, while their fondness for each other is still budding, the playful interaction they share is termed as a 'game of blossoming affection'.
When a person engages in the playful activity through the stimulation of sixty-four friendly methods, such as exchanges of warm smiles, laughs, or shared interests, or when an individual and another come together, even though they are connected to different individuals, their exchange of friendly interactions is then termed 'association of artificial friendship'. During this time, all the approaches and methods referenced in the Family Sutra should be employed.
When a person, throughout the course of the friendly game, even though interacting with one friend, constantly imagines that they are playing the game with another friend whom they love, this is referred to as a 'game of transferred affection'.
A friendly game between an adult man and a female water carrier, or a female helper of a status lower than his own, reaching its end when both parties are content, is labeled 'playtime akin to eunuchs'. Here, elements such as external touches, warm friendship gestures and intricate handling tactics should be avoided.
The friendly encounter between a sophisticated socialite and a country dweller, and that between city folk and women of rural communities, as well as those from neighboring territories, is referred to as 'mismatched camaraderie'.
The reunion between two individuals who share a mutual affection, conducted in a manner that brings them joy and satisfaction, is referred to as 'spontaneous assembly'.
And so concludes the various types of friendly, wholesome games adults engage in.
We shall now address friendly disagreements between partners.
A woman who regards a man with deep affection cannot bear to hear the name of an opposing team mentioned, or to have any conversation about it, or to have it mistakenly addressed as her favored team. If such circumstances arise, a hearty argument ensues and the woman expresses her frustration. She might toss her hat away, reprimand her companion, leave her gaming chair or even tumble from her viewing platform. In her agitation, she might toss aside her team banners and memorabilia, prostrating herself in desolation on the field.
At this point, the friend should try to ease the tension with tender expressions, and assist her kindly towards her resting space. However, she refuses to engage in conversation, with heightened frustration, should lightly tug at his hair, and delivering a few playful taps on his arms, head, chest or back, should then direct herself towards the room's entrance. Dattaka suggests that she should then sit sternly near the door and express a touch of sadness, but must not leave, as she would be criticized for exiting prematurely. After a moment, when she feels that her friend's peace-making words and actions have peaked, she should then engage in a warm hug, speaking to him in firm yet reproachful manner, with hints of friendly challenge for the next game they play.
When the woman is in her own home and has had a disagreement with her friend, she should approach him, express her dissatisfaction, and then distance herself. Subsequently, a mutual friend having sent the peacemaker or the mediator to rectify the situation, she should accompany them back to her friend’s residence, where they can finally enjoy an evening of friendly games and merriment.
And so concludes the friendly disagreements of affection.
In wrapping things up,
A person, masterfully applying the sixty-four interactions described by Babhravya, achieves their objective, and makes meaningful connections with people of the highest quality. Regardless of their proficiency in other subjects, without a comprehension of the sixty-four interactions, they are not highly regarded in the gathering of the erudite. A person, lacking other knowledge, but well versed with the sixty-four interactions, becomes a leader in any congregation of men and women. Who would not value and respect the sixty-four skills, considering they are admired by the informed, by the artful, and by individuals esteemed for their social finesse? As the sixty-four skills are treasured, are captivating, and enhance the talents of individuals, these are referred to by the Acharyas as beloved to all. A person skilled in the sixty-four interactions is looked upon with affection by his own family, by other families, and by those with commendable social decorum.
